# Calculating h0 file block using sha-256

For run this program it's simple, you need just run the following command:

python sha256CalculingH0.py "FuncoesResumo - SHA1.mp4"

running this command with example file will generate the following output:

h0 for file in FuncoesResumo - SHA1.mp4   302256b74111bcba1c04282a1e31da7e547d4a7098cdaec8330d48bd87569516

If you want change the file that you need calculate h0, you need just upload a new file
in root of this path and execute python sha256CalculingH0.py "nameOfYourFile"
